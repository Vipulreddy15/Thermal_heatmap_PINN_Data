# Chip Thermal PINN Dataset Generator

This repository contains a physics-based framework for generating synthetic thermal maps for multiple processor classes.

## Processor Types Modeled
- Intel Core (mobile)
- AMD Ryzen (mobile)
- Apple Silicon (M-series)
- Intel Xeon
- AMD Threadripper
- Qualcomm Snapdragon
- Apple A-series
- MediaTek Dimensity

## Methodology

Temperature fields are generated by solving the steady-state heat equation:

∇²T + Q = 0

Power distributions are scaled according to publicly available processor specifications such as die size and TDP.

## Output

For each sample:
- Full temperature field (.npy)
- Rendered heatmap (.png)
- Sparse sensor readings (.npz)

## Usage

```bash
python pinn2.py
